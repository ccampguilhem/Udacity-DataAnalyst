    "This project is related to Data Wrangling with MongoDB course for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) web services.\n",
    "- Clean the data by fixing few issues introduced by users.\n",
    "- Store the dataset in a database to make any further analysis easier.\n",

    "OpenStreetMap is open data, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF). \n",

    "- **screen scraping** with [Requests](http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), an http Python library for making requests on web services,\n",
    "- **parsing** XML files with iterative and SAX parsers with Python standard library [xml.etree.ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html?highlight=iterparse#module-xml.etree.ElementTree) and [xml.sax](https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.sax.html),\n",
    "- **auditing** (validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity) and **cleaning** data with Python,\n",
    "    - validity: does data conform to a schema ?\n",
    "    - accuracy: does data conform to gold standard (a dataset we trust) ?\n",
    "    - completeness: do we have all records ?\n",
    "    - consistency: is dataset providing contradictory information ?\n",
    "    - uniformity: are all data provided in the same units ?\n",
    "- **storing** data into SQL database (SQLite) with Python [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) module and [MongoDG](https://www.mongodb.com/) no-SQL database.\n",
    "- exploring dataset **statistics** as per project requirements (size of the file, number of unique users, number of nodes and ways, number of chosen type of nodes, like cafes, shops etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The storing step will make use of [csv](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html?highlight=csv#module-csv) and [json](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html?highlight=json#module-json) formats respectively for SQL and MongoDB exports.\n",

    "Udacity instructors said thad many data analysts reports spending most of their time (up to around 75%) wrangling data, at the end of this project I can say that I now better understand that statement :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is also a with a lot of trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can probably spend infinite amount of time auditing and cleaning large datasets. The more time is spent on wrangling and the less time will be passed on data exploration tasks. But also the more potential applications we can have with the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The way dataset is made persistant also plays an important role. Schema may be strict and improve the ease of use during data exploration but also decreases the potential of reusability for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of techniques, there are a lot of improvements we can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset of the project remains very small. Even the 1 Gb dataset is small and can fit into memory. So I haven't really explored all techniques for dealing with large datasets: if I used SAX XML parsers, I also, at some point, had a Python dictionnary with the whole dataset in memory. JSON writing also requires to have a full dataset in memory. I gave a brief try to shelve and diskcache modules but I found them very slow, probably a misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- String comparison may fail, due to different case, accented characters or not, use of - in names,... We could probably increase the flexibility of cleaning (and auting) steps by using some fuzzy comparisons. In addition,  caution is needed to properly deal with unicode strings, encoding and decoding ([Ned Batchelder talk at Pycon 2012 is worth the detour.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHbC6udIqc))\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, my first experience in SQL helps but is not enough when it comes to bigger requests (with subrequests, pivoting...) so I need more practice. MongoDB is the first no-SQL database I use, so I need to practice even more with aggregation pipelines and lookups once I have updated my configuration. I have also seen that it exists a lot of Object Relational Mapping systems based on Python and Mongodb. This would probably worth a try when I have some spare time :)"
